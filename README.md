    <p>
        This project is a Flutter-based text translation app that uses the 
        <strong>Google Translator API</strong> to translate text between multiple languages. 
        The app allows users to input text, select the source and target languages, and get 
        real-time translations. The UI is intuitive, offering clear language dropdown options 
        and a user-friendly interface.
